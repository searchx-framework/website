SearchX is a scalable collaborative search system being developed by [Lambda Lab](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/lambda-lab/) of [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/).
It is based on [Pienapple Search](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pra2.2016.14505301122/full) and is further developed to facilitate collaborative search and sensemaking. SearchX includes features that enable crowdsourced user studies on collaborative search, and is easily extensible for new research.

# Documentation

SearchX is separeted in frontend and backend. 

## Frontend

Apart from serving the interface, the front end also manages user data and defines the logs sent back to the back end.
It is built on NodeJS using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) framework and is served through [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). For more details about the frontend go to the [SearchX-frontend](https://github.com/felipemoraes/searchx-frontend) repository.

## Backend

The backend is responsible for fetching search requests to the search provider and managing the application's data. 
It is built on NodeJS and exposes its endpoints through [express](https://expressjs.com/) (API) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/) (Websockets). For more details about the backend go to the [SearchX-backend](https://github.com/felipemoraes/searchx-backend) repository.
